This application uses the youtube api for playing workout videos. To use it you must get an api key. The following link contains instructions on how to get an api key. https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started

After you get the keys, create a file called gradle.properties in the BoringButBig folder. In that file, add the following following strings TheMovieDB_ApiKey="YourKeyGoesHere" and Youtube_ApiKey="YourKeyGoesHere".

Also, the youtube app is required for video playback in the app.

This app was tested on a Samsung Galaxy S9+ and a Lenovo Tab 4 10.

If you are unable to reach the development application server, use the release one instead.

If you are interested you can take a look at the BoringButBig server.  It uses spring boot.
